This holiday
You'll be far away
And I'll be all alone
So please remember
This December
To fully charge your phone
Text me Merry Christmas
Let me know you care
Just a word or two
Of text from you
Will remind me you're still there You don't have to add much to it
One smiley face will do
Baby text me Merry Christmas
Cause I'm missing kissing you

I don't care if you spell things right
I just want to hear from you tonight
Stroke those keys with your delicate touch
And type those little words that mean so much!

Hi

Miss you
Miss you too
Xmas sucks without you
I know lol
Love you
Love you
